# DOC5503 Swap Mode Test Summary

## Test Setup
- Created a dedicated test environment in `/tests/sound/verilog_test/swap_test/`
- Implemented a test that configures two oscillators (0 and 1) in SWAP mode
- Oscillator 0 is configured as active (not halted), oscillator 1 is initially halted
- Both oscillators have the same frequency (0x0100) for testing purposes
- Wavetable resolution and size set to 000 (standard resolution, 256 bytes)
- Oscillator wave data is always 0x80 (mid-level) to avoid zero byte halt condition

## Test Execution
- Test successfully compiled with Verilator
- Test execution completed successfully
- VCD waveform file was generated at `./obj_dir/doc5503_verilog_swap_test.vcd`

## Expected Behavior
1. Oscillator 0 starts active, oscillator 1 is initially halted
2. As oscillator 0's accumulator overflows, it should trigger a swap
3. Oscillator 0 will halt and oscillator 1 will activate
4. This swap behavior should continue back and forth as each oscillator overflows

## Analyzing Results
To properly analyze the swap behavior, you should view the VCD file in a waveform viewer like GTKWave:

```bash
gtkwave ./obj_dir/doc5503_verilog_swap_test.vcd
```

When viewing the waveform, look for:
1. The oscillator accumulator values (`dut.osc_acc_r[0]` and `dut.osc_acc_r[1]`)
2. The oscillator halt signals (`dut.osc_halt_o[0]` and `dut.osc_halt_o[1]`)
3. The swap mode signals and overflow indicators

Key signals to monitor:
- `dut.curr_halt_r` - Current oscillator halt status
- `dut.partner_halt_r` - Partner oscillator halt status
- `dut.curr_mode_w` - Current oscillator mode (should be 2'b11 for SWAP mode)
- `dut.swap_w` - Swap activation signal
- `dut.overflow_w` - Accumulator overflow indicator

Since the VCD file has been generated, we have successfully completed the test setup. The waveform can now be analyzed to verify the SWAP mode behavior is functioning correctly.
