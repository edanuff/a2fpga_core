## Overview of the DOC5503 Sound Chip

The DOC5503 (Digital Oscillator Chip) is a 32-voice polyphonic sound engine used in the Apple IIgs and various Ensoniq synthesizers. It's a complex digital oscillator system that uses wavetable synthesis to generate sound.

### Key Features

1. **32 Digital Oscillators** - Each can be individually configured
2. **Wavetable Synthesis** - Uses memory-resident waveforms
3. **Multiple Oscillator Modes** - Free-running, one-shot, sync/AM, and swap modes
4. **Flexible Resolution** - Adjustable wavetable resolutions
5. **Variable Table Size** - Wavetable sizes from 256 bytes to 32KB
6. **Multi-Channel Output** - Can route oscillators to different output channels
7. **IRQ Generation** - For oscillator completion notification

## Register Map

The DOC5503 uses a set of 229 registers (8 bits each) for configuration:

## Oscillator Enable Register ($E1)

**NOTE**: The original documentation has a discrepancy here that caused an off-by-one error in our implementation.

**Correct Behavior**:
- Bits 5-1 represent (number of oscillators - 1)
- When set to 0, only 1 oscillator is enabled
- When set to 31 (all bits set), all 32 oscillators are enabled

**Setting the Register**:
- To enable N oscillators, set bits 5-1 to (N-1)
- For example, to enable all 32 oscillators, set bits 5-1 to 31 (value 0x3E)

## Oscillator Modes

### Free-running Mode (00)
The oscillator continuously loops through the waveform table until halted or a zero value is encountered.

### One-shot Mode (01)
The oscillator plays through the waveform once, then halts at the end.

### Sync/AM Mode (10)
Uses pairs of oscillators with special behaviors:
- **AM Mode**: When the lower oscillator is odd, it amplitude-modulates the even oscillator.
- **Sync Mode**: When the lower oscillator is even, it synchronizes the odd oscillator's phase.

### Swap Mode (11)
Uses pairs of oscillators where the lower is even, higher is odd:
- The oscillator runs in one-shot mode
- When completed, it resets and triggers the next oscillator
- Allows for complex chained sounds

## Timing and Processing

The DOC5503 divides the input clock by 8 for each oscillator cycle. In the Apple IIgs, the clock is 7.15909 MHz, giving an effective maximum frequency of 894,886.25 Hz per oscillator.

Each oscillator gets 8 clock cycles for processing, except the last oscillator which gets 24 cycles (related to RAM refresh in the original hardware).

## Important Testing Considerations

1. **Oscillator Enable Register ($E1) Correction**:
   - The implementation must handle bits 5-1 as the actual oscillator count minus one
   - This needs thorough testing with different oscillator counts

2. **Mixing Logic Synchronization**:
   - The mixer FSM should sync properly with the oscillator FSM
   - Test with different numbers of enabled oscillators (1, 16, 31, 32)

3. **Oscillator Modes**:
   - Test all four modes, especially the paired modes (Sync/AM and Swap)
   - Verify oscillator behavior when encountering zero in waveform

4. **Resolution and Table Size**:
   - Test different combinations of resolution and table size
   - Verify correct memory addressing for each combination

5. **Audio Output Quality**:
   - Test with various volumes and wavetables
   - Look for any timing-related audio artifacts

## Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Off-by-one Error in $E1 Register**:
   - When all 32 oscillators are enabled (value 0x3E), some implementations may only process 31
   - Test both 0x3E and 0x3D to ensure correct behavior

2. **Mixer Timing Issues**:
   - With 31+ oscillators enabled, there may be synchronization issues with the mixer
   - Watch for periodic dips or noise in the audio output

3. **Oscillator Counting Logic**:
   - The cycle_max_w calculation needs to correctly handle the full range of oscillator counts
   - Test edge cases (1 oscillator, 32 oscillators)

## Testing Goals

1. Verify correct implementation of all registers and modes
2. Ensure all 32 oscillators can be properly enabled and utilized
3. Validate audio output quality with different configurations
4. Test boundary conditions and timing edge cases
5. Verify proper handling of the $E1 register and oscillator counting
