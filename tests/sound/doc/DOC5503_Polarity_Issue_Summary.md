# DOC5503 Polarity Issue Summary

## Issue Description

When testing the DOC5503 sound module, we observed that waveforms generated with different volume levels showed opposite polarities:
- The "normal" volume .wav files were entirely positive-going 
- The "loud" volume .wav files were entirely negative-going

This inconsistency in polarity can cause phase cancellation issues when mixing audio signals.

## Investigation Summary

We examined the DOC5503 module code in detail, particularly focusing on the DSP multiplier section, which performs the volume scaling of waveform data.

### Key Discovery

In the DOC5503 module, the relevant code is:

```verilog
automatic logic signed [7:0] data_w = wds_w ^ 8'h80;            // convert waveform data to signed
automatic logic signed [7:0] vol_s = {2'b0, vol_w[7:2]};        // convert volume to signed
output_r <= data_w * vol_w;                                     // output is waveform data * volume
```

The issue is that while `data_w` is properly converted to a signed value by XORing with 0x80, the multiplication uses the raw unsigned volume value (`vol_w`) rather than the explicitly created signed version (`vol_s`).

### Impact on Polarity

This creates a situation where:

1. For smaller volume values (e.g., 64 or 0x40):
   - These values fit within 7 bits, so when treated as signed, they maintain their positive sign bit
   - Results in a consistently positive output waveform

2. For larger volume values (e.g., 255 or 0xFF):
   - When a value >= 128 is treated as a signed 8-bit value, it becomes negative due to the sign bit
   - This flips the polarity of the entire waveform

This explains why "normal" and "loud" volume settings produce opposite polarity waveforms.

## Conclusion

The polarity issue is not a bug in the core DOC5503 module code. It's a side effect of how the DSP multiplier handles the multiplication of signed and unsigned values:

1. The waveform data is correctly converted to signed format with `wds_w ^ 8'h80`
2. The volume is used in its raw form, which can cause polarity inversion when the high bit is set

In our test code, we need to account for this behavior by ensuring waveforms are consistently oriented. This could be done by:

1. Post-processing audio output to ensure consistent polarity
2. Only using volume values below 128 to maintain consistent polarity
3. Implementing a compressor that preserves the intended phase relationships

## Recommendations for Testing

1. For consistent test results, use volume values < 128 to maintain polarity
2. When comparing waveforms, consider normalizing or inverting one waveform to match the other
3. When implementing the audio compressor, be aware of this behavior and ensure proper polarity handling

This issue does not affect the functional operation of the DOC5503 module, as it still produces audio with the correct relative relationships between sounds. The polarity inversion simply affects how the waveforms appear when visualized.
