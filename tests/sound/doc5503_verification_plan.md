# DOC5503 Verilog Implementation Verification Plan

This document outlines the approach for verifying the DOC5503 Verilog implementation against the established C++ ES5503 emulation to ensure accurate hardware behavior.

## Overview

The ES5503/DOC5503 is a complex digital oscillator chip with 32 oscillators, each with their own set of registers and behaviors. We have:

1. A SystemVerilog implementation (`doc5503.sv`)
2. A standalone C++ ES5503 emulator (`es5503_standalone.cpp`)
3. The original MAME C++ ES5503 emulator (`MAME/es5503.cpp`)

Our goal is to verify that the SystemVerilog implementation produces identical or nearly identical audio outputs as the C++ emulator, which is considered a valid reference for the original hardware's behavior.

## Verification Strategy

### 1. Feature-Level Verification

Test each of these key features individually:

- **Oscillator Enable Mechanism**: Ensure correct operation with different oscillator counts
- **Wavetable Addressing**: Test all wavetable sizes and resolution combinations
- **Oscillator Modes**: Test all four oscillator modes (Free Run, One Shot, Sync/AM, Swap)
- **Volume Scaling**: Test various volume settings
- **Frequency Control**: Test various frequency settings
- **Reset Behavior**: Test behavior after reset
- **Halt Mechanism**: Test halting logic, including detection of 0x00 samples
- **Interrupt Generation**: Test IRQ assertions

### 2. Test Infrastructure Enhancements

Modify the existing test harness (`doc5503_harness.sv` and `doc5503_tb.cpp`) to:

1. Create a synchronized verification environment where both Verilog and C++ implementations:
   - Receive identical register settings
   - Process identical input data
   - Generate comparable output samples

2. Add a reference model class in C++ that runs our verified ES5503 emulator in parallel with the Verilog DUT

3. Create a comparison mechanism to analyze outputs from both implementations

### 3. Test Cases

#### Basic Waveform Tests
- Triangle wave (simple continuous function)
- Sine wave (complex continuous function)
- Square wave (transition handling)
- Sawtooth wave (ramp behavior)

#### Wavetable Format Tests
- Test with various table sizes (256B to 32KB)
- Test all resolution combinations (0-7)
- Test the halt value (0x00) detection
- Test the zero-crossing center value (0x80)

#### Oscillator Mode Tests
- Free Run mode with looping
- One Shot mode with automatic halting
- Sync/AM mode between oscillator pairs
- Swap mode between oscillator pairs

#### Register Interface Tests
- Read and write to all registers
- Test register reset values
- Test register update timing

#### Advanced Tests
- Test with real-world wavetables (e.g., frontleft.wavetable)
- Multiple oscillator interactions
- Edge cases like oscillator transitions
- A/B comparison between Verilog and C++ audio outputs

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Test Infrastructure

1. **Create C++ Reference Model**
   - Integrate `es5503_standalone.cpp` into the test bench
   - Add cycle-accurate simulation to match timing with Verilog DUT
   - Implement identical register interface

2. **Extend Verilog Testbench**
   - Add more probing points in `doc5503_harness.sv`
   - Expose internal states for detailed comparison
   - Create a synchronized test mechanism

3. **Develop Audio Comparison Tools**
   - Time-domain sample comparison
   - Frequency-domain (FFT) analysis
   - Perceptual audio comparison

### Phase 2: Basic Feature Testing

Implement test cases for:
- Oscillator enable logic (already tested)
- Wavetable addressing
- Basic waveform generation
- Volume and frequency controls

### Phase 3: Advanced Feature Testing

Implement test cases for:
- Oscillator modes (Free Run, One Shot, Sync/AM, Swap)
- Multi-oscillator interactions
- IRQ generation
- Edge case handling

### Phase 4: Real-World Application Testing

- Test with frontleft.wavetable
- Test with generated wavetables from our C++ emulator
- Verify audio output quality
- Compare with known-good outputs

## Expected Deliverables

1. Enhanced test bench with C++ reference model integration
2. Suite of test cases covering all DOC5503 features
3. Automated comparison tools for audio output verification
4. Documentation of verification results
5. Identification and fixes for any discrepancies

## Success Criteria

The Verilog implementation is considered verified when:

1. It produces sample outputs within 1% tolerance of the C++ reference model
2. All register behaviors match the documented ES5503 behavior
3. All oscillator modes function correctly
4. Real-world wavetable playback sounds identical to the C++ implementation
5. Edge cases are handled correctly

This verification plan will ensure that our DOC5503 Verilog implementation accurately reproduces the behavior of the original ES5503 chip, allowing for authentic audio reproduction in the FPGA implementation.
