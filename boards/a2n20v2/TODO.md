# A2N20v2 TODO

## High Priority

- [ ] Investigate the timing of bus sampling in `apple_bus.sv` - some IIgs systems have sporadic issues with garbage data, specifically around when the data byte is sampled (likely too soon or too late)

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Verify all Apple II, //e, and IIgs graphics modes work correctly
- [ ] Test Mockingboard audio output quality
- [ ] Add support for additional virtual slot cards

## Low Priority / Future

- [ ] Improve Super Serial Card compatibility
- [ ] Document button functions (accent/accent reset behavior)
- [ ] Consider migrating proven features from Enhanced version
- [ ] Add scanline effect toggle via button

## Known Issues

- IIgs bus timing may cause sporadic garbage data on some systems (see High Priority)

## Build Status

- Last verified build: 2026-01-16
- Timing: All constraints met
- This is the stable/production version for Tang Nano 20K with IIgs support
