# A2N20v1 TODO

**Deprecated** - This board support package is provided for reference purposes. It should continue to build but is planned for retirement.

## Maintenance Tasks

- [ ] Keep in sync with critical bug fixes from a2n20v2

- Only supports Apple II and //e models
- Superseded by a2n20v2 which uses 100-pin CPLD

## Build Status

- Last verified build: Unknown
- Recommend verifying build after shared HDL changes
