# DDR3 Framebuffer 480p — Design Document

## Overview

`ddr3_framebuffer_480p.v` is a DDR3-backed framebuffer for the Tang Mega 60K
(A2Mega variant) that displays Apple II video at 480p (720x480 @ 59.94 Hz)
over HDMI. Unlike the 720p reference design (`ddr3_framebuffer.v`) which
performs arbitrary upscaling, this module uses **integer 2x vertical scaling**
with no horizontal scaling, producing clean pixel-perfect output.

The Apple II framebuffer (560x192 or 640x200) is stored in DDR3 SDRAM. Pixels
are written by the Apple II logic domain, stored via an async FIFO and batch
writer, then read back one scanline at a time into a line buffer BRAM for
display on the HDMI output.

### Key Design Differences from 720p Reference

| Aspect | 720p (`ddr3_framebuffer.v`) | 480p (`ddr3_framebuffer_480p.v`) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Output resolution | 1280x720p @ 60 Hz | 720x480p @ 59.94 Hz |
| HDMI pixel clock | Internal PLL (74.25 MHz = `clk_x1`) | External board PLL (27 MHz `clk_pixel`) |
| Clock domains | `clk_x1` used for both DDR3 and HDMI | Separate: `clk_x1` (DDR3), `clk_pixel` (HDMI) |
| Scaling | Fractional upscaling via accumulators | Integer 2x vertical, 1:1 horizontal, borders |
| Read buffer | 64-pixel prefetch register in `clk_x1` | 1024-entry line buffer BRAM, true dual-port |
| Scanline effects | None | Odd-line dimming (50% brightness) |

The critical architectural consequence is that the 720p version has **one clock
domain** for both DDR3 reads and HDMI output (both use `clk_x1` at 74.25 MHz),
so no CDC is needed for pixel data. The 480p version has **separate clock
domains** (`clk_x1` for DDR3, `clk_pixel` for HDMI), requiring a true
dual-port BRAM to bridge them.

| Clock | Frequency | Domain | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|
| `clk_pixel` | 27 MHz | HDMI output | Pixel generation, HDMI encoder, line buffer reads |
| `clk_pixel_x5` | 135 MHz | TMDS | HDMI serialization (5x pixel clock) |
| `clk` | 54 MHz | Apple II logic | Framebuffer writes (`fb_we`, `fb_data`) |
| `clk_x1` | 74.25 MHz | DDR3 app | DDR3 read/write commands, line buffer fills |
| `memory_clk` | 297 MHz | DDR3 PHY | Internal to DDR3 controller |
| `clk_g` | 50 MHz | Reference | PLL configuration, DDR3 controller reference |

### Clock Relationships

- `clk_pixel` (27 MHz) and `clk_x1` (74.25 MHz) are **asynchronous** — derived
  from different PLLs. All signals crossing between them require proper CDC.
- `clk_x1 / clk_pixel` = 74.25 / 27 = 2.75x — `clk_x1` is 2.75x faster
  than the pixel clock. This means for every pixel displayed, the DDR3 domain
  has ~2.75 cycles to work with.
- `clk` (54 MHz) is asynchronous to all others — the async FIFO handles the
  write-path CDC.

### Counter Behavior (from `hdmi.sv`)

- `cx` increments every `clk_pixel` rising edge. Wraps: 857 → 0.
- `cy` increments when `cx` wraps (i.e., at the transition from cx=857 to
  cx=0). Wraps: 524 → 0.
- Visible area: `cx < 720 && cy < 480` (registered one cycle delayed in HDMI
  module).
- `cy=0` is the **first visible line** (assuming `START_Y=0`).

## Display Layout (Active Area Within 720x480)

For Apple II mode (560x192):
```
              720 pixels
  |<--80-->|<---560--->|<--80-->|
  |  h_bdr |  active   | h_bdr |  cy=0..47   (v_border = 48 lines)
  |--------|-----------|--------|
  |  h_bdr |  FB line 0| h_bdr |  cy=48,49   (2 HDMI lines per FB line)
  |  h_bdr |  FB line 0| h_bdr |
  |  h_bdr |  FB line 1| h_bdr |  cy=50,51
  |  h_bdr |  FB line 1| h_bdr |
  |  ...   |    ...    |  ...  |
  |  h_bdr | FB line191| h_bdr |  cy=430,431
  |  h_bdr | FB line191| h_bdr |
  |--------|-----------|--------|
  |  h_bdr |  active   | h_bdr |  cy=432..479 (v_border = 48 lines)
```

### Border Calculations

```
h_border = (720 - fb_width) / 2     = (720 - 560) / 2 = 80
v_border = (480 - fb_height*2) / 2  = (480 - 384) / 2 = 48

h_active_start = h_border            = 80
h_active_end   = 720 - h_border      = 640
v_active_start = v_border             = 48
v_active_end   = 480 - v_border       = 432

FB line number = (cy - v_active_start) / 2  (integer division)
```

For VGC/SHR mode (640x200):
```
h_border = (720 - 640) / 2 = 40
v_border = (480 - 400) / 2 = 40
```

## Data Flow: Write Path

    v

```

### Write Path Details

1. **Pixel Grouping** (`clk` domain): Incoming pixels are accumulated 4 at a
   time into `wgrp_data`. Each pixel occupies `COLOR_BITS` within a
   `4*COLOR_BITS` word. When 4 pixels are ready, `wgrp_pending` is set.

2. **Async FIFO**: 64-entry deep, `4*COLOR_BITS` wide. Uses gray-code pointer
   synchronization for safe CDC between `clk` (54 MHz) and `clk_x1`
   (74.25 MHz). The `read_available` output gives the fill level in `clk_x1`
   domain.

3. **Batch Write Controller** (`clk_x1`): Waits for 8+ groups in FIFO, then
   issues 8 consecutive DDR3 writes (32 pixels). This batching amortizes DDR3
   command overhead. The `mem_dir_write` flag is set during write batches to
   prevent read/write conflicts on the DDR3 bus.

4. **Frame Reset**: On `fb_vsync` rising edge (detected via toggle CDC to
   `clk_x1`), the FIFO is drained of stale data and write coordinates
   (`wr_x`, `wr_y`) reset to (0,0).

5. **DDR3 Address Layout**: Each pixel occupies 32 bits in DDR3 regardless of
   `COLOR_BITS` (zero-padded). Address = `{row * WIDTH + col, 1'b0}` where
   the `1'b0` is the byte-address LSB (16-bit DDR3 data bus, so addresses are
   in units of 16-bit words; each 128-bit burst = 8 × 16-bit words = 4
   pixels).

### Read Path Details

#### 1. cy Clock Domain Crossing

The `cy` counter is in `clk_pixel` (27 MHz) and must be safely brought to
`clk_x1` (74.25 MHz) to determine which FB line to fetch.

**Why gray code:** Binary multi-bit CDC via double-flop is unsafe. When
multiple bits change simultaneously (e.g., 47→48 = 0b0101111→0b0110000, 5 bits
change), the synchronizer can capture any combination of old/new bits for one
cycle, producing a glitched intermediate value. Gray code guarantees only 1 bit
changes per increment, making double-flop synchronization safe.

```
clk_pixel:  cy → gray encode → cy_gray
                                   |
clk_x1:                    cy_gray_sync0 → cy_gray_sync1
                                              |
                                     gray→binary decode
                                              |
                                          cy_sync1 (safe 10-bit value)
```

**Latency:** 2 `clk_x1` cycles for the double-flop, plus 1 `clk_pixel` cycle
for the gray encode register = ~2-3 `clk_x1` cycles total (~27-40 ns). This
means `cy_sync1` lags the real `cy` by a few cycles, but this is acceptable
because the lag is much smaller than a scanline period.

#### 2. Line Buffer (True Dual-Port BRAM)

```verilog
reg [COLOR_BITS-1:0] line_buf [0:1023];  // synthesis → SDPB BRAM

// Write port (clk_x1)
always @(posedge clk_x1)
    if (lb_wr_en)
        line_buf[lb_wr_addr] <= lb_wr_data;

// Read port (clk_pixel)
always @(posedge clk_pixel)
    lb_rd_data <= line_buf[lb_rd_addr];
```

True dual-port BRAM on Gowin FPGAs supports simultaneous read and write on
different clocks natively. The Gowin synthesis tool infers an SDPB (Simple
Dual-Port Block RAM) primitive from this pattern. No additional CDC logic is
needed for the data path — the BRAM handles it at the hardware level.

**Size:** 1024 entries × 18 bits = 18 Kbits (fits in a single Gowin BSRAM
block which provides 18 Kbits).

#### 3. Line Fetch Trigger Logic

The fetch logic runs in `clk_x1` and monitors `cy_sync1` to detect when the
display has moved to a new FB line:

```
cy_sync1 changes (detected via cy_prev comparison)
    |
    ├── cy near v_active_start (VBlank) AND line 0 not yet fetched
    |       → trigger fetch of line 0
    |
    └── cy in active area AND fb_line_x1 != last_fetched_line
            → trigger fetch of current FB line
```

**VBlank prefetch:** Line 0 is fetched 2 scanlines before the active area
begins (`cy_is_vblank_before_active`), ensuring it's ready before the first
visible scanline.

**Active area fetch:** When `fb_line_x1` (= `(cy_sync1 - v_active_start) >> 1`)
differs from `last_fetched_line`, a new fetch is triggered. With 2x vertical
scaling, each FB line is displayed for 2 HDMI scanlines, so the fetch triggers
on the first scanline of each pair.

#### 4. DDR3 Read Sequence

Once `line_fetch_active` is set:

```
[ddr3_rw block]                    [response handler block]
     |                                      |
  fetch_pixel_x = 0                         |
     |                                      |
  Issue READ cmd ──────────────────→  DDR3 controller
  addr = fetch_pixel_x + line_addr         |
  fetch_pixel_x += 4                       |
  rd_pending = 1                           |
     |                              app_rd_data_valid
     | (wait for rd_done)                  |
     |                              Latch 128-bit response
     |                              Write pixel 0 → line_buf[fetch_write_x]
     |                              Write pixel 1 → line_buf[fetch_write_x+1]
     |                              Write pixel 2 → line_buf[fetch_write_x+2]
     |                              Write pixel 3 → line_buf[fetch_write_x+3]
     |                              fetch_write_x += 4
     | ←── rd_done pulse ──────────  rd_pixel_idx reaches 3
  rd_pending = 0                           |
     |                                      |
  (repeat until fetch_pixel_x >= fb_width)  |
     |                                      |
  fetch_pixel_x done                 fetch_write_x >= fb_width
     |                              line_fetch_active = 0
```

**Key constraint:** `rd_pending` ensures only one DDR3 read is in flight at a
time. This prevents response overlap that previously caused a "barcode pattern"
artifact. The DDR3 controller returns responses in order, with ~15-20 cycle
latency.

**Timing budget:** For 560-pixel width: 140 reads × ~20 cycles each = ~2800
`clk_x1` cycles = ~37.7 us. A scanline is 858 × (74.25/27) = ~2360 `clk_x1`
cycles = ~31.8 us. **This is tight!** The one-at-a-time `rd_pending` approach
means the fetch may take slightly longer than one scanline. However, since each
FB line displays for 2 scanlines, we have ~63.6 us total, which is comfortably
sufficient.

**Important: The one-at-a-time read constraint is a bottleneck.** Future
optimization could pipeline reads (issue next read while previous response is
being processed) to reduce total fetch time to ~20 us. This would require a
small response FIFO or careful tracking of in-flight reads.

#### 5. Display Output

The output path runs entirely in `clk_pixel` (27 MHz):

1. **Read address generation:** `lb_rd_addr = next_cx - h_active_start_px`,
   set one cycle early to account for BRAM read latency.

2. **Pixel selection:** `in_active ? lb_rd_data : border_color_px`

3. **Color conversion:** `torgb()` function expands `COLOR_BITS` to RGB888:
   - 18-bit (RGB666): `{R[5:0],2'b0, G[5:0],2'b0, B[5:0],2'b0}`

4. **Scanline dimming:** Odd HDMI lines (`cy[0]==1`) are displayed at 50%
   brightness via right-shift: `{1'b0, R[7:1], 1'b0, G[7:1], 1'b0, B[7:1]}`.
   This produces a CRT-like scanline effect.

5. **Sleep/reset:** Black screen when `sleep_sync1` or `ddr_rst` is active.

6. **Overlay mux:** In the HDMI encoder instantiation, `overlay_en_i` selects
   between the framebuffer `rgb` and the debug overlay `overlay_rgb_i`. The
   debug overlay (DebugOverlay module) provides status information.

### Line Buffer: Why No Ping-Pong

**Previous approach (ping-pong, eliminated):** Two BRAM banks alternated: one
being filled while the other was read. A `lb_fill_sel` signal toggled on fill
completion and was CDC'd to the read side as `lb_read_sel`. This caused
multiple problems:

1. **Mid-scanline bank switching:** `lb_fill_sel` toggled when the fill
   completed (mid-scanline in `clk_x1`). The CDC propagated this to
   `clk_pixel` mid-scanline, causing the read side to switch banks partway
   through a line → visible horizontal ripple.

2. **Latching attempts failed:** Latching `lb_read_sel` at `cx==0` eliminated
   the mid-scanline switching but introduced bank-alignment problems. With 2x
   vertical scaling, the toggle from filling line N+1 caused the second
   scanline of line N's display pair to read from the wrong bank.

3. **Fundamental incompatibility:** A 2-bank ping-pong with 2x vertical
   scaling requires the display to read the same bank for 2 consecutive
   scanlines, but each fill toggles the bank. The timing of when the toggle
   occurs, when the CDC propagates, and when the read side samples it creates
   unavoidable race conditions across the asynchronous clock boundary.

**Current approach (single buffer, true dual-port BRAM):** A single 1024-entry
BRAM with write port on `clk_x1` and read port on `clk_pixel`. The FPGA's
BRAM primitive handles the cross-clock access at the hardware level. No bank
selection signal needs to cross clock domains.

**Write/read overlap safety:** The fetch of a new FB line writes to addresses
0..559 (or 0..639) while the display reads from those same addresses. However:

- Each FB line is displayed for 2 HDMI scanlines (~63.6 us at 27 MHz).
- The fetch takes ~37.7 us (one-at-a-time reads) or potentially less with
  optimization.
- The fetch triggers when `fb_line_x1` changes, which is at the start of the
  first HDMI scanline of a new pair.
- During the fetch period, the display is reading old data that is being
  overwritten. For the brief overlap window, BRAM reads may return either old
  or new data depending on exact timing. Since the new data is what we want
  displayed (it IS the current line), either outcome is visually acceptable.
- By the second HDMI scanline of the pair, the fetch is complete and the
  buffer contains the correct data for the entire scanline.

**Remaining concern:** The first few pixels of the first HDMI scanline of each
pair may show stale data from the previous line, since the fetch and display
start at roughly the same time (both triggered by the cy transition). In
practice, the cy CDC latency means the fetch starts 2-3 `clk_x1` cycles after
the real cy transition, by which time the display has only advanced a few
pixels into the visible area. If this is visible, the fix would be to trigger
the fetch earlier (e.g., during the second scanline of the PREVIOUS pair) to
ensure data is ready before the new pair begins.

## DDR3 Read/Write Arbitration

Both read and write operations share the single DDR3 controller port. The
arbitration logic in the `ddr3_rw` always block handles this:

```
Priority: Writes > Reads

if (write pending) {
    Issue write command + data
    Wait for completion
} else if (fetch_needs_reset) {
    Reset fetch_pixel_x to 0 for new line
} else if (line fetch active && not all pixels read && !rd_pending) {
    Issue read command
    Set rd_pending
}
```

**`mem_dir_write` flag:** Set during write batches to prevent the read path
from issuing commands. Cleared when the batch completes. This ensures writes
get uninterrupted DDR3 access during their batch window.

**`rd_pending` flag:** Owned by the `ddr3_rw` block. Set when a read command
is issued, cleared by the `rd_done` pulse from the response handler. Ensures
only one read is in flight at a time.

**Two-block architecture:** The response handler and the DDR3 command issuer
are in separate always blocks (Verilog requires each `reg` to be assigned in
exactly one always block). Communication is via:
- `rd_done` wire (response handler → command issuer): pulse to clear
  `rd_pending`
- `line_fetch_active` (response handler → command issuer): indicates a fetch
  is in progress
- `fetch_line_addr` (response handler → command issuer): base address for
  current line's reads

## Known Issues and Future Work

### Current Status: Jitter Under Investigation

The display currently shows some form of jitter or visual artifact related to
the timing of line buffer fills relative to display reads. The single-buffer
approach eliminates the ping-pong CDC races but introduces a write/read overlap
window during the first scanline of each 2-line pair.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Pipelined DDR3 reads:** Issue the next read command while the previous
   response is being written to the line buffer. This would roughly halve the
   fetch time from ~37.7 us to ~20 us, providing more margin. Requires
   tracking one in-flight read or a small response FIFO.

2. **Prefetch timing:** Trigger the fetch of line N+1 during the second HDMI
   scanline of line N's display pair. This ensures the buffer is completely
   filled before the first scanline of line N+1's pair begins reading.
   Requires careful tracking to avoid overwriting data that the second
   scanline of the current pair still needs. (This is the core ping-pong
   problem that was eliminated — revisiting it would require a 2-bank approach
   with correct CDC.)

3. **Triple buffering:** Use 3 line buffer banks to completely decouple fill
   and read timing. One bank is being filled, one is being displayed, and one
   is idle (ready for the next fill). This eliminates all timing races at the
   cost of 3x BRAM usage (3 × 18 Kbits = 54 Kbits, still feasible).

4. **cx CDC to clk_x1:** Instead of (or in addition to) cy CDC, bring cx to
   `clk_x1` to know exactly where the display raster is. This would allow
   the fetch logic to start during HBlank with guaranteed safety.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Ping-pong CDC is hard with 2x vertical scaling.** The fundamental
   conflict: 2x scaling means 2 scanlines read the same bank, but each fill
   toggles the bank. Any approach that toggles a bank-select signal across an
   async clock boundary risks mid-scanline or inter-scanline misalignment.

2. **True dual-port BRAM is the simplest CDC mechanism for bulk data.** The
   FPGA's BRAM primitive handles cross-clock access at the hardware level,
   eliminating the need for explicit CDC on the data path.

3. **One-at-a-time DDR3 reads prevent response overlap.** The DDR3 controller
   returns responses in order, but if multiple reads are in flight, the
   responses arrive in rapid succession and can overwhelm the 4-cycle
   writeback pipeline. The `rd_pending` flag serializes access.

4. **Gray-code CDC is essential for multi-bit counters.** The `cy` counter has
   transitions where 5+ bits change simultaneously (e.g., 47→48). Standard
   double-flop CDC would produce glitched intermediate values. Gray code
   ensures only 1 bit changes per increment.

5. **Diagnostic tests are invaluable.** The systematic approach of bypassing
   components (test #1: bypass line buffer; test #2: bypass DDR3) definitively
   identified the ping-pong CDC as the root cause, after multiple speculative
   fixes had failed.
