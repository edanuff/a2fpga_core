; broker_test.s - traffic generator for the S7 broker bench (tb_gs_broker.sv)
;
; Built by run_gs_broker_sim.sh (ca65 / ld65, broker_rom.cfg) into a 128 KB
; ROM image laid out like a ROM 01: bank FE, then bank FF.  The bench loads
; it into the card's ROM image AND into the motherboard / reference machine
; models, exactly as the real ROM would be (scoping doc 2.6).
;
; The program runs in bank FF in native mode, so nothing it does to the
; bank-00/01 map (language card, RAMRD, ALTZP, IOLC inhibit) moves the code
; under it.  It walks every kind of access the broker has to place - local
; RAM and ROM, forwarded (shadowed) writes back to back, posted writes with a
; socket read right behind them, I/O, R-M-W on I/O, banks E0/E1, the
; language card, aux memory, STATEREG, block moves, slot space, IOLC inhibit,
; all-banks shadow, a BRK through the interrupt-dispatch ROM - and stores
; what it read in $0300... .  It does not judge the results itself: a
; lockstep reference core on an ideal machine does (every byte the broker
; delivers is compared), and the bench checks a few of the stored values and
; the signature at $037F.
;
; The comments give the byte each "res" is expected to store.
