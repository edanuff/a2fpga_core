// Description
// -----------
// The card serves ROM from an image of its own (gs_accel_broker: the far ROM
// memory).  The image is the machine's: this module reads it through the
// socket, as docs/gs_socket_s7_accelerator_scoping.md 2.6 has it, and nothing
// of Apple's is in the bitstream.
//
// On start_i it asks the broker to hold the core between two steps.  While
// the core is held the socket's idle cycles are reads of the address given
// here; each completed one is a byte of the image.  128 KB (ROM 01: FE0000 -
// FFFFFF) is 131072 PHI2 cycles, about 46 ms, during which the machine sees
// a CPU that reads ROM and takes no interrupt.  Then every entry of the near
// memory is made empty (a byte read from the image before the copy may be
// in it), the hold is dropped and the core goes on with the step it was
// about to take.
//
// Neither memory's write port is in a hurry, and the far ROM image is sixty-four
// blocks anywhere on the die, so both are given time (the board build's
// constraints say so): a byte's address and data are registered two clks before
// its write enable, which lasts two clks; a near-memory index is held for two
// clks with the flush asserted throughout (a write that lands on another index
// while the address moves makes that entry empty too, which is the point).
//
// valid_o says a complete image has been copied since power-up; it drops
// when a new copy starts and when one is cut short (the socket lost, /RES).
// The caller must not let the card's memory be used without it.
