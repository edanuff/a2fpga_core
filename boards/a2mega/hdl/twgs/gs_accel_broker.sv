// Description
// -----------
// S2-S6 clock the core with PHI2: one core step per motherboard cycle.  Here
// the core lives in the accelerator's own clock domain (clk, the PHY's pin-
// sequencer clock) and is stepped with a clock enable; this module decides,
// step by step, where the step's bus cycle is performed
// (docs/gs_socket_s7_accelerator_scoping.md 2.1-2.4, 9):
//
//  * LOCAL: the memory-map replica (gs_mmu_replica) says the access belongs
//    to the card - banks 00/01, the ROM image, backed expansion banks.  The
//    local memory port is strobed ADDR_CLKS clocks into the step and the
//    core steps STEP_CLKS clocks after the previous step.  The socket shows
//    an idle cycle (below).
//  * SOCKET: everything else - I/O, slot space, banks E0/E1, unbacked banks.
//    The core is held (no clock enable), the cycle is handed to the PHY at
//    its next issue point, runs as exactly one PHI2 cycle with the PHY's
//    timing, and the core steps on the PHI2 fall that completes it, taking
//    the byte the socket pads held at that fall.  RDY low at the fall
//    repeats the cycle, as the PHY and a real 65816 do.
//  * POSTED WRITE: a local RAM write the machine shadows into E0/E1
//    (replica: forward_write) is stored locally at once AND queued in a
//    one-deep buffer to be run on the socket as an ordinary bank-00/01
//    write, so the FPI does its shadow copy.  The core does not wait for
//    it; a second forwarded write waits until the buffer is free.  Order on
//    the socket is program order: the buffer always goes out before any
//    later socket cycle of the core (which is necessarily younger, because
//    the core stops at the first one it needs).  A read of a just-posted
//    location is a local read of the byte just stored.
//  * IDLE: a PHI2 cycle with nothing to carry is a read of PARK_ADDR (a ROM
//    address in bank FF: a fast cycle, no refresh interplay, no side effect
//    anywhere in the machine) with VDA = VPA = 0.  Departure from the
//    scoping doc's "previous address repeated": repeating a previous I/O or
//    slot address would repeat its side effects (9).
//  * HOLD (hold_i): the core is not stepped past the step in progress.  The
//    sequencer waits in ST_SOCK with no request; the socket's idle cycles are
//    then reads of idle_a_i, each reported when it completes (idle_stb_o).
//    gs_accel_romcopy uses it to read the ROM image through the socket; with
//    nm_flush_i it also empties the near memory.  The step that was held makes
//    no use of the near-memory byte launched for it.
//
// Internal cycles of the core (VDA = VPA = 0) carry no data.  In fast mode
// they reach the socket only when their address could matter to the machine
// (I/O or slot space), exactly as S6 would have shown them: an internal
// cycle aimed at $C0xx of banks 00/01/E0/E1 repeats the previous step's
// address as a read (the S5 phantom-$C028 rule, gs_socket_65816_scoping 4.5;
// the broker does the substitution itself, because the PHY's "previous
// address" would be the park address), elsewhere the core's own address.
//
// Modes (runtime, taken at step boundaries):
//  * native_i = 1: every step is a socket cycle, one per PHI2 cycle, issued
//    and completed exactly as S6 does it - pin for pin (the bench compares
//    against an S6 PHY + PHI2-clocked core running beside it).
//      - mem_bypass_i = 1: read data comes from the socket for everything,
//        i.e. S6.  Writes are still copied into the card's memory, so the
//        card's copy of banks 00/01 stays current.
//      - mem_bypass_i = 0: the card's memory is still the memory of record
//        (reads of local regions use it; every write also goes out on the
//        socket), so native and fast can be switched in either direction at
//        any time.  Each local read is also compared with the byte the
//        socket returned (verify_*: the scoping doc's "verify mode").  The
//        comparison means something only until fast mode first runs: after
//        that the motherboard's copy of banks 00/01 is stale by design.
//    Clearing mem_bypass_i is only coherent while the card's memory is a
//    complete copy; setting it is only coherent while the motherboard's is,
//    i.e. as long as fast mode has not run since power-up.
//  * native_i = 0: fast mode, as above.  RDY low at the last PHI2 fall also
//    holds local steps (the TransWarp's GS_PAUSE).
//
// Reset.  The core's reset is the PHY's (the machine's /RES, held until it
// has been high at two PHI2 falls), re-registered here.  While it is low the
// replica's switches take their reset values, the core is in reset, and the
// socket shows what S6 shows: the core's reset-state address as a read.  A
// posted write that is still in the buffer when /RES falls is dropped (the
// PHY cannot write during reset): at most one byte of a shadowed page, which
// the card's own memory still holds.  The card's memory is kept (warm reset).
//
// Clocking / CDC.  One domain: clk.  The socket pads (D0-7, RDY, /IRQ, /NMI,
// /ABORT) are sampled by flops clocked on the PHI2 fall (the instant a 65816
// samples them) and read here only at or after phy_fall_evt_i, at least one
// clk later - the same quasi-static crossing gs_socket_phy uses for the
// core's outputs.  A native step uses exactly those samples.  In fast mode
// the three interrupt lines go through ordinary two-flop synchronisers
// instead, so the core never acts on a level that is a PHI2 cycle old.  The
// PHY reads this module's phy_* outputs only in its issue clock
// (phy_issue_evt_i).  In native mode the next request must be presented by
// that clock: ADDR_CLKS <= OUT_DELAY + out_extra of the PHY.
//
// The core is taken through its port list (CLK = clk, RST_N, CE, RDY_IN tied
// high, IRQ/NMI/ABORT, D_IN, and its bus outputs), so P65C816 and F65C816
// are interchangeable.
//
// Local memory and the data-late step (DATA_LATE = 1, F65C816 only).  The
// memories are synchronous: a read is LAUNCHED (lm_ren_o registers the RAM
// and the ROM-image address, both memories read) and its data is used
// STEP_CLKS later.  Without DATA_LATE every local read is launched at the
// step's strobe from the core's address (two-edge step: ADDR_CLKS to form the
// address, the rest of the step for the data).  With DATA_LATE the broker also
// launches a read at the clock-enable edge of every local step, at the core's
// NEXT-step address (cpu_na_i = F65C816.NA_OUT, translated as a read by the
// replica's pf_ port), so that the following step finds its data already
// there and the whole step is one STEP_CLKS-long path.  The launch is a
// speculation and it is checked, not assumed: the broker remembers what the
// memories' output registers hold (ld_*), and when the step runs it compares
// that with the address the step really needs on the memory it really uses.
// A match uses the data; anything else - the step after a socket cycle (no
// launch: the socket data arrives too late to form the next address), a soft
// switch that moved the map, a vector pull, a local write since the launch -
// launches the read again, one clk after the strobe and from registers
// (ml_*), and waits a full STEP_CLKS for it.  The select of the core's data
// source (card RAM, card ROM, socket) is speculated and checked the same way:
// it is set at the launch from the replica's view of the next address, and a
// step that needs a different source sets it one clk after the strobe and
// waits.  Correctness therefore never rests on the guess, only speed.
// Timing shape this gives a build: core registers reach the memories'
// read-address pins and the data-source select only through the next-address
// path, once per step (a STEP_CLKS-cycle path, like memory data -> core and
// core -> core); everything else the broker registers from the core's outputs
// is captured at the strobe (an ADDR_CLKS-cycle path), and the select changes
// at least STEP_CLKS before the core takes the data.
// A write goes to the RAM at the strobe, always at least one clock before the
// next launch, so a launch never coincides with a write.
//
// Near memory (NEAR = 1; with DATA_LATE, ADDR_CLKS = 2): the two-clk step.
// The banks and the ROM image are too many blocks to sit close to one core,
// and a decode of the core's NEXT address is too much logic to hang behind it.
// So the core's next address drives two things only: ea_r (with the status,
// the step's address as a register from the moment the core steps) and the
// read address of a small memory of its own, a direct-mapped cache of single
// bytes, read at every core step.  An entry is {tag, byte}; the index is the
// low NEAR_AW bits of the address, untranslated; the tag is what else
// identifies the physical byte - ROM or RAM, the address bits above the index,
// and whether the language card moved A12.
//   Two tiers of decode, both from those registers, neither ahead.  In the
// step's FIRST clk a cheap view (gs_mmu_decode fast_*: bank, page, a few
// switches - a subset of "the card's alone", proven against the full decode on
// every vector of the decode sweep) says whether the step is one of the common
// ones: a read in banks 00/01 outside $Cxxx or in a ROM bank, a write in banks
// 00/01 where nothing is shadowed, an internal cycle outside $Cxxx.  For those
// the same view gives the tag and the tag read at the launch is compared with
// it.  Three registers come out of that clk - completes anyway (fa_q: a write
// or an internal cycle), completes if the byte is there (fb_q: a read), the
// byte is there (fh_q) - and in the SECOND clk the core's clock enable is one
// gate behind them: ce_r | fa_q | (fb_q & fh_q).  Such a step is two clks, the
// step after a socket cycle included.  Everything else - a socket cycle, a
// near miss, an expansion bank, a forwarded or language-card write, $Cxxx,
// a vector pull, RDY low - is the sequencer as it was, deciding from the
// registered copy of the FULL decode (aq_*), which has two clks to settle:
// from the third clk.  Nothing is decoded ahead (pl_fresh is never set).
//   A miss is the "read not there yet" path (ml_*), the ONLY way the big
// memories ("far") are read: registered address, their data into alt_q, and
// the byte is also written into the near memory before the step ends.  The
// core's data is the near memory's byte or alt_q (far data, or the socket
// byte): one mux.  A local write is registered when the step is decided and
// made in the clk after, from registers, to both memories; a near entry
// written at or after the launch of the read that follows it is not used
// (nl_ok).  So the far memories are reached and left only through registers
// and can be placed anywhere, and the near memory never holds anything the far
// memory does not, whatever the map does (a tag names a physical byte, not an
// address).  A miss costs wall time, never a step.
//
//   One physical byte must live under one index.  The only local bytes with
// two addresses that differ below A14 are $C000-$CFFF of banks 00/01: the
// language card's bank 1 (read and written as $Dxxx) and, with I/O and
// language-card shadowing inhibited, plain RAM at $Cxxx.  They are kept under
// the $Dxxx index only: a write through $Cxxx goes to that entry, a read
// through $Cxxx is always served by the far memory.
