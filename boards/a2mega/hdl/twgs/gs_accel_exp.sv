// Description
// -----------
// The card's copy of the expansion banks (02 up) in a memory of any latency -
// the DDR3, through whatever crosses to its clock.  gs_accel_broker reaches
// the big memories only on a near-memory miss, and for this one it waits
// (lm_rwait) instead of counting clks; this module is what it waits for.
//
// One queue, in program order: every write the broker makes to a bank above
// 01 goes in, and so does a read when one is launched.  The memory port takes
// them one at a time (m_req_o / m_ready_i) and answers reads in the order it
// took them (m_rvalid_i).  A read therefore sees every write made before it,
// whatever the memory's latency.
//
// Read:   rd_i (the broker's lm_ren_o with lm_rexp_o) queues it and raises
//         rwait_o from the next clk.  When the byte comes back rwait_o falls
//         (the clk after m_rvalid_i) and rdata_o holds the byte from that clk
//         until the next read.  rsel_o: the last far read launched was one
//         of these - the caller's data mux (the RAM's byte is rdata_o).
// Write:  wr_i queues it.  wbusy_o (a register, a clk behind the queue): the
//         queue is within WMARGIN entries of full - the broker then holds every step that could write here at its
//         strobe (a step already past it still makes its one write).  A native
//         step is never held: its writes come once per PHI2 cycle, far below
//         what the memory takes.  ovf_o (sticky): something was queued with
//         the queue full, and lost - it must never be seen.
// Reset:  the queue is kept (its writes were made by steps that completed).
//         A read whose step the reset cut short still comes back: it is counted
//         and its byte dropped.
