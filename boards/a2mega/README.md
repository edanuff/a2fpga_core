# A2Mega Card

> Status (2026-10-25): describes board revision 1.0a3 (unreleased, under development; two SOM
> options). Hardware verification of the ESP32 feature port on the a2mega itself is not
> recorded in the repo; the a2p25 carries the same firmware and verified it there.

The A2Mega is the A2FPGA Apple II card built around a Sipeed Tang Mega SOM on a carrier of
our own design. Two interchangeable SOMs are supported, each with its own project:

| SOM | Device | Project | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tang Mega 60K | GW5AT-LV60PG484AC1/I0 | `a2mega.gprj` | BSRAM-bound (107/118); the three classic cards are off on this die |
| Tang Mega 138K | GW5AST-LV138PG484AC1/I0 | `a2mega_138B.gprj` | all cards; the 65C816 in-socket build (`GS_SOCKET`); its own DP SERDES IP generated in the IDE |

The board's one external port is USB-C: 4-lane DisplayPort Alt Mode (2 lanes used, HBR,
1080p), USB 2 to the ESP32, and USB-PD, with a TUSB1046A redriver and a FUSB302B PD
controller managed by the ESP32. There is no SD card and no USB-A port; storage and input go
through the ESP32. The framebuffer, the shadow memory and the Ensoniq wavetable live in DDR3.
The next revision, 1.0a4, is specified in
[docs/board_1_0a4_requirements.md](docs/board_1_0a4_requirements.md) and gated on the
exercise plan.

What the core carries (decided in `hdl/a2mega_profile.vh` and per die in `dp_test_die_pkg`):
Apple II / //e / IIgs video including SHR through `framebuffer_1080p` and the shared
DisplayPort core; the IIgs Ensoniq DOC in the fabric with its wavetable in DDR3 (pipelined
DOC); Disk II (slot 5), ProDOS hard disk (slot 6) and Uthernet II (slot 3, bridged to WiFi);
on the 138K also SuperSprite, Mockingboard and the Super Serial Card; IIgs autodetect on the
bus; on the 138K, optionally, the IIgs's own CPU socket.

## Building and flashing

```bash
GPRJ=a2mega.gprj      tools/build.sh a2mega     # 60K SOM
GPRJ=a2mega_138B.gprj tools/build.sh a2mega     # 138K SOM
GPRJ=a2mega.gprj      tools/flash.sh a2mega     # to SPI flash; --sram for a volatile test load
```

`GPRJ=` is required: the board has several projects (the two cores, `a2mega_dp_test*.gprj`
colorbars benches for each die, `flash_rescue.gprj`). Flashing goes through the ESP32-S3's USB
JTAG bridge (`openFPGALoader -c esp32s3`); the GW5A rules (SecurityBit off in every project, a
500 kHz flash phase, bulk-erase first when the board's state is unknown) are in
`docs/gotchas.md` and applied by `tools/flash.sh`. Every a2mega build is held to the timing
policy in [docs/timing_round2.md](docs/timing_round2.md): no re-rolls, +0.5 ns on every clock,
three clean rolls of the final source. Over the network, the ESP32 can stream a bitstream to
the FPGA (`tools/fpga_stream.py`, port 2323) and reload it from the telnet console.

## ESP32-S3 coprocessor

The on-board ESP32-S3 runs the shared firmware in [`src/a2fpga_esp32/`](src/a2fpga_esp32/)
(`make compile` with `arduino-cli`; `BOARD_REV=103` for this board), which also serves the
a2p25. It owns the USB-C PD / Alt Mode policy and HPD, the JTAG bridge and the FPGA updater,
and the a2mega port of the a2n20v2-Enhanced feature set over the 8-bit OSPI link
([docs/ESP32_ENHANCED_PORT.md](docs/ESP32_ENHANCED_PORT.md), [docs/ESP32_OSPI_DESIGN.md](docs/ESP32_OSPI_DESIGN.md)):

- on-screen menu and console rendered by the FPGA's OSD overlay, also mirrored on a telnet
  console over WiFi
- Disk II (.nib/.dsk/.do/.po/.2mg) and ProDOS hard disk (.hdv/.po/.2mg) image serving, with a
  file picker; images live on the ESP32's flash filesystem and arrive by FTP (no SD card on 1.0a3)
- Uthernet II (W5100) networking: the FPGA emulates the W5100 in MACRAW mode and the ESP32
  bridges frames to WiFi with MAC NAT (`wifi.txt` on the filesystem: SSID, password, optional
  static address)
- runtime slot configuration and the Apple II reset hold until media is mounted
- FPGA core self-update from a bitstream file, over JTAG to the config flash

Menu input from a USB gamepad, keyboard or remote on the USB-C port is the feature port's
item P2 ([boards/a2p25/docs/ESP32_FEATURE_PORT.md](../a2p25/docs/ESP32_FEATURE_PORT.md)),
verified on the a2p25.
