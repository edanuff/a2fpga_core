# A2P25 Card

> Status (2026-10-25): rewritten for the displayport1 board revision. The IIgs boots on the
> new core over DisplayPort 1080p with SHR and DOC audio (2026-10-11); the board is in
> active bring-up and not a release.

The A2P25 is the A2FPGA Apple II card built around the
[Tang Primer 25K](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-primer-25k/primer-25k.html)
SOM (Gowin GW5A-LV25MG121). The current board revision, **displayport1**, adds a 64 Mbit
HyperBus PSRAM (Infineon S27KL0642), an ESP32-S3 coprocessor on an 8-bit OSPI link, and a
USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode output driven from the GW5A's hardened MIPI D-PHY used as a raw
serializer (4 lanes, RBR, 1080p) through an SN75DP130 retimer. It is unreleased and under
development; the earlier revision is not maintained.

What the core carries on this board (decided in `hdl/a2p25_profile.vh`; the GW5A-25 is
logic-bound at ~97% CLS and 52/56 BSRAM):

- Apple II / //e / IIgs video including SHR, through a HyperRAM framebuffer scanned out at
  1080p over DisplayPort (`framebuffer_1080p` + the shared `hdl/displayport` core)
- IIgs Ensoniq DOC in the fabric (`doc5503_pipelined`, wavetable in HyperRAM behind a fetch
  cache at the arbiter's top priority)
- Disk II (slot 5) and ProDOS hard disk (slot 6) images served by the ESP32
- IIgs autodetect on the bus; the Apple's reset is held by the ESP32 until media is mounted
- Off for the first fit: SuperSprite, Mockingboard (resource budget), Super Serial Card (no
  UART pins on this revision), Uthernet II (BSRAM budget)

## Building and flashing

```bash
tools/build.sh a2p25                    # a2p25.gprj (the only full-core project)
tools/flash.sh a2p25                    # through the on-board ESP32-S3 (openFPGALoader -c esp32s3)
```

The board has several bench projects beside the core: `a2p25_dp_test*.gprj` (DisplayPort
colorbars, 2 and 4 lanes, probes, blind-sink and AUX-observation variants),
`a2p25_psram_test_ck54/81/108.gprj` (the HyperRAM eye-scan test at three clock rates) and
`legacy_a2p25_rev0.gprj` (the previous revision's core under `hdl/legacy/`, not maintained). Pass
`GPRJ=<file>` to `tools/build.sh` and `tools/flash.sh` for those; both refuse to guess.
Build with `bit_security 0` as every GW5A project here does (see `docs/gotchas.md`).

## ESP32-S3 coprocessor

The board runs the **shared a2mega ESP32-S3 firmware** (`boards/a2mega/src/a2fpga_esp32/`)
built as board revision 225: USB-C PD and DP Alt Mode entry (FUSB302B, mux control, HPD
reconstruction from PD VDMs), the Enhanced feature set over the OSPI link (on-screen menu and
console, Disk II and HDD image serving, slot configuration, reset hold), WiFi with a telnet
console and FTP, and network bitstream streaming. Build and flash instructions:
[docs/ESP32_FW_A2P25.md](docs/ESP32_FW_A2P25.md); the feature port's status:
[docs/ESP32_FEATURE_PORT.md](docs/ESP32_FEATURE_PORT.md) (P1–P4 verified 2026-10-12). Storage is
the ESP32's LittleFS plus USB mass storage on the ESP32's own USB port; there is no SD card.
