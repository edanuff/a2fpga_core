# ESP32 firmware on the a2-p25 "displayport1" board

The a2-p25 displayport1 revision runs the **a2mega ESP32-S3 firmware**
(`boards/a2mega/src/a2fpga_esp32/`) built as board revision **225**. The
old LCAM-era firmware under `boards/a2p25/src/` does not match this board
and is not used.

What the a2mega firmware brings over unchanged: the USB-C PD stack
(FUSB302B), DP alt-mode entry and mux control, HPD-to-FPGA reconstruction
from PD VDMs (level plus 0.75 ms IRQ pulses), WiFi, the telnet console,
FTP, network bitstream streaming, the JTAG updater and the USB JTAG bridge.

## Build and flash

```sh
cd boards/a2mega/src/a2fpga_esp32
make BOARD_REV=225 compile              # dp_test variant (default DP_TEST=1)
make BOARD_REV=225 DP_TEST=0 compile    # variant for an OSPI-speaking core
make BOARD_REV=225 PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX upload
```

- **Module:** ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N4R2, the same as the a2mega 1.0a3. The
  Makefile uses the same FQBN: `FlashSize=4M, PSRAM=enabled,
  PartitionScheme=no_ota, USBMode=hwcdc, CDCOnBoot=cdc`.
- **Upload port:** use **USB1**, the ESP32's own USB-C port (native USB on
  IO19/IO20). It is a separate connector from the video port (USB2), so the
  CDC console (`+++` then `help`) stays available while a monitor is
  attached.
- **Download mode:** hold S2 (BOOT, IO0) and tap S1 (EN). See the /RES
  warning below: the Apple II is held in reset while the ESP32 is in
  download mode.
- **Shared build directory:** every revision builds into `./build`.
  arduino-cli rebuilds fully when the defines change. Run `make clean` if
  in doubt.
- **Build result (2026-10-01):** arduino-cli 1.2.2 with esp32 core 3.3.5.
  All three variants compile clean (`--warnings all`, no new warnings):
  - 225 dp_test: 999,339 B (47 %) of the 2 MB app partition.
  - 225 OSPI: 1,025,123 B.
  - 103: 1,032,955 B.

  `make BOARD_REV=225 compile` produced
  `build/a2fpga_esp32.ino.bin` with sha256 `d43c6b44…29504`. Nothing has
  been flashed yet.

| EN | 45 | CHIP_PU | R22 10k / C15 1 µF, S1 to GND | reset button |

**Differences from the a2mega 1.0a3**, all handled in `board_pins.h`:

- JTAG is TCK=39, TMS=40, TDI=41, TDO=42. The a2mega uses 40/41/42 with
  TDO on 39.
- I2C is on IO4/IO3 instead of IO1/IO2. FUSB302B INT_N is on IO5 instead of
  IO3.
- VBUS_SRC_EN is on IO6 instead of the IO46 strap pin.
- There is no debug UART on IO43/IO44.
- There is no PPO bus and no ESP_GPIO spares.
- IO38 is the FPGA RECONFIG_N, so the JTAG bridge's TRST dummy moved to the
  unconnected IO7. **Never park TRST on IO38 on this board.**

The expected pin map from the task was confirmed on every line, with
JTAG order TCK/TMS/TDI/TDO = IO39/40/41/42.

**Strapping pins:**

- IO0 is button-only. The module's internal pull-up gives a normal boot.
- IO3 (SDA) is high through R23. It only matters if the STRAP_JTAG_SEL
  eFuse is burned.
- IO45 and IO46 are NC.

No strap hazards.

## I2C bus (DP_I2C, 400 kHz, 10k pull-ups)

| Device | Ref | Strap | 7-bit address | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FUSB302BMPX | U10 | part suffix (B = base) | **0x22** | -B01 would be 0x23, -B10 0x24, -B11 0x25 |
| TUSB546A-DCI | U8 | I2C_EN = R44 1k to 3V3 (I2C mode); A0 (pin 11) and A1 (pin 14) **NC** | **0x12** expected | Same floating-strap situation as the a2mega's TUSB1046A, which answers at 0x12. The firmware probes 0x12 and falls back to scanning 0x10–0x17 (`tusb_detect_addr`). |
| SN75DP130 | U7 | ADDR_EQ (pin 3) = GND | **0x2C** (design doc) | The firmware probes 0x2C, then 0x2D–0x2F. |

Run `i2cscan` (CLI) or `i` (telnet) to confirm on first power-up. All
three parts are on the same bus. The FPGA is not on it.

**TUSB546A vs TUSB1046A:**

- The pinout is identical: same WQFN-40 footprint, and every pin name
  matches the a2mega usage.
- The firmware uses the same register map: General `0x0A` (CTLSEL, FLIPSEL,
  HPDIN_OVRRIDE, EQ_OVERRIDE), DPEQ `0x10`/`0x11`, DPCTL3 `0x13` (snoop
  disable + AUX_SBU_OVR).
- Board strapping matches the a2mega too: CTL1/HPDIN (pin 23) and
  HPDIN/DCI_CLK (pin 32) are NC, and HPDIN_OVRRIDE is set as on the a2mega.
  The DPEQ0/A1, SSEQ0/A0, DPEQ1, SSEQ1, EQ0 and EQ1 pins all float. The
  firmware sets EQ_OVERRIDE plus register EQ (setting 0) before enabling
  lanes, exactly as on the a2mega.
- **Not verified locally** (no TUSB546A datasheet on disk):
  - whether the DP EQ step table matches the 1046A ladder that the telnet
    `+`/`-` labels assume (the dB labels may be off);
  - whether any 546A-specific register bit differs.
- The main delta is USB3 Gen1 vs Gen2, which is unused here.

**SN75DP130 wiring:**

- ADDR_EQ (pin 3) = GND.
- EN (pin 26) is NC; per the design doc it has an internal 200k pull-up.
- RSTN (pin 35) has only C29 100 nF to GND (internal pull-up plus a
  power-on delay). **No ESP32 control**: the only reset lever is a power
  cycle, or I2C if the datasheet exposes a soft reset.
- HPD_SNK (pin 11) is R39 10k to 3V3 (always awake). HPD_SRC and CAD_SRC
  are NC.
- CAD_SNK (pin 10) is R40 100k to GND (DP mode).
- DDC pins are NC.
- AUX_SNK goes to TUSB AUX with R41 (100k to GND on P) and R42 (100k to
  3V3 on N), the source-side bias.
- All of this matches DP_ALTMODE_DPHY_DESIGN.md §4.

## What is compiled out or changed for 225

| Feature | a2mega 103 | a2p25 225 | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| SD card | none (LittleFS at /sdcard) | none (LittleFS at /sdcard) | `A2MEGA_HAS_SD 0` |
| PD + DP mux | yes | yes | `A2MEGA_HAS_USBC_PD 1` |
| SN75DP130 driver | n/a | probe + raw dump/write | `A2MEGA_HAS_DP130 1` (`sn75dp130.c`) |
| FPGA debug UART | IO44 RX / IO43 TX | dp_test only: RX on IO11, no TX | `A2MEGA_HAS_FPGA_UART` |
| OSPI link + menu/disk/W5100 tasks | yes | DP_TEST=0 only | `A2MEGA_HAS_OSPI_LINK` |
| HPD wire to FPGA | IO33 (ESP_GPIO0) | dp_test: IO10; otherwise none | `PIN_DP_HPD_OUT` (−1 = record only) |
| Apple /RES driver | FPGA | ESP32 IO33; production builds hold /RES from boot until the disk task reports the mounts done or a 15 s backstop (`a2_reset_hold_release`, 10-12); dp_test releases at once | `PIN_A2_RESET_OUT` |
| USB host on the module's USB-C (USB1) | same hardware (1.0a3) — untested there | `usbhost.cpp`: device-first role policy (5 s window, BOOT held = device), then OTG host: XInput pads, HID keyboards/remotes → OSD menu buttons | `A2MEGA_HAS_OSPI_LINK` (production builds only) |
| PPO bus, ESP_GPIO spares | IO5–10, IO33–38 | n/a | not defined for 225 |
| LEDs | n/a | LED0 heartbeat, LED1 = HPD | `PIN_LED0/1` |

## dp_test mode (`A2P25_DP_TEST=1`, the default)

The DP bring-up bitstream (`boards/a2p25/hdl/dp_test/a2p25_dp_test_top.sv`
and its `.cst`) has no OSPI service. It repurposes two ESP32-link balls:

- **HPD:** ball B2 (ESP32_INT_N) is the bitstream's `dp_hpd` input, with
  PULL_MODE=DOWN. The firmware drives **IO10** with the PD-derived HPD
  level and the 0.75 ms IRQ_HPD low pulses. This is the same code path as
  the a2mega (`hal_set_fpga_hpd` and `hal_pulse_fpga_hpd_irq`). Telnet `r`
  pulses HPD low for 250 ms to restart the training ladder. LED1 mirrors
  HPD.
- **Telemetry:** ball C2 (ESP32_OPI_D0) is the bitstream's `uart_tx`,
  115200 8N1. The P1–P6 status lines repeat every ~0.34 s. The firmware
  runs `Serial1.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, 11, -1)`, which routes UART1 RX
  to IO11 through the GPIO matrix with no TX pin. Each line goes to three
  consumers, exactly as on the a2mega:
  - USB CDC (`Serial`);
  - the telnet console tee (`telnetd_console_tee`);
  - `wedge_watch_line()`, the auto virtual-replug policy, toggled with
    telnet `w`.
- **OSPI is never initialized** in this mode. `start_subsystems()` returns
  immediately, and the CLI's spi* commands report "not supported". Bringing
  up SPI2 would claim IO11 away from UART1. The OSD console, gamepad menu
  and disk serving do not exist with this bitstream anyway. Use telnet or
  USB CDC.
- ~8 s after boot, a one-shot `UARTDIAG: RX11 EDGES=… LOW=…` line reports
  whether the telemetry pad is toggling. A healthy line idles high with
  edge bursts.

⚠ **Do not run a DP_TEST=1 firmware against a production (OSPI) core.** In
production the FPGA drives B2 as INT_N, so both ends would drive IO10.
DP_TEST=0 leaves IO10 as an input. HPD for a production core must then
travel as an OSPI register write, which is not implemented yet: a
production displayport1 core and its register don't exist yet. In that
build `hal_set_fpga_hpd` only records the level.

## PD: Data-Role Swap for powered adapters (2026-10-12)

Plan §6h, adapter #2: a Cable Matters USB-C→HDMI adapter with its own
USB-C power input advertises as a **PD source** when that power is
connected. The DRP port then attaches as **sink + UFP**, takes the 5 V
contract, and `pd` reported `state device (sink power role, UFP data
role)`, HPD 0, mux-DP 0: DP Alt Mode never came up, because only the DFP
runs the Discover Identity / SVIDs / Modes → Enter Mode → DP Status /
Configure ladder. A Mac handles this class by requesting a **DR_Swap**
(PD control message 9) after the explicit contract, becoming DFP while
staying a power sink.

The stack already sent one DR_Swap after PS_RDY (`SINK_READY` →
`SINK_DR_SWAP_SENT`), but any `Wait`, a `Reject`, or 200 ms of silence
parked the port in `device` for the rest of the attach. A freshly
contracted DFP is normally busy with its own Discover Identity toward us
and answers `Wait` (or our swap crosses its VDM), so one shot was not
enough. Now (`usbc_port.c`, all inside the `power_sink` path):

- after `PS_RDY`, DR_Swap goes out ~10 ms later with a sink + UFP header;
- `Accept` → data role DFP (`fusb302_set_data_role`, so the auto-GoodCRC
  and every later header say DFP), power role stays sink, then the
  **same** VDM ladder, TUSB546A mux programming (`set_dp_outputs`) and
  HPD reconstruction as the source+DFP attach — no separate code path;
- `Wait` → retry after tDRSwapWait (100 ms), up to 10 attempts;
- no answer in 200 ms → retry, up to 3 unanswered sends;
- `Reject` (or PD3 `Not_Supported`) → give up at once;
- giving up = `state device` (plain USB device, DP outputs off), **one**
  `[usbc]` error line per contract (`DR_Swap rejected…` / `…unanswered…`
  / `…Wait persisted…`); a renegotiation (new `Source_Caps` → contract)
  re-arms the budget; a partner-initiated DR_Swap is still accepted;
- an `Accept` that arrives before our own TX_SUCCESS completes the send
  (the ACK-before-TXOK race fixed for VDMs on 2026-09-02) so the
  Discover Identity is not refused with `tx_busy`.

Bus-powered partners (we source VBUS and are DFP from the toggle: the
a2mega hubs, the a2p25 monitors, the Anker hub) never enter this path;
their negotiation is unchanged and the census results stand
(`boards/a2mega/docs/acquisition_matrix_results.md`). Host test:
`tests/host/test_dr_swap.c` (11 scenarios incl. the source-path smoke
test), run with `tests/host/run.sh`. Hardware verification with
adapter #2 powered is pending (expect `pd: state dp-active (sink power
role, DFP data role)`, HPD 1, mux-DP 1; its AUX replies were undecodable
in the bus-powered case, so DP may still not train — that is the AUX
margin question in §6h, separate from this fix).

Build (2026-10-12, on 5b541a5f = the USB-host / USB-storage / OTA
self-update tree; arduino-cli 1.2.2 / esp32 3.3.5, 0 warnings, not
flashed):

| Variant | Size | `a2fpga_esp32.ino.bin` sha256 |
|---|---|---|
| `make BOARD_REV=225 DP_TEST=0 compile` (production, OSPI core) | 1,113,959 B (84 % of the OTA slot) | `a79c4ff5e74c80c6287bf7d53aa334281cc2ed1cce302456090bbd21c292d060` |
| `make BOARD_REV=225 DP_TEST=1 compile` (dp_test) | 1,001,055 B | `585053934145c6df88c0583ebc2423b32f53b6bc10c75a48c46939e2650a817b` |

Both variants share `./build`; the DP_TEST=1 binary is the one left there.
Rebuild the variant you flash and check the hash before uploading. Note
the partition scheme changed to `default` (two OTA slots) with the OTA
work: the first flash of a build on this scheme is a download-mode flash
to install the new partition table; after that, updates are a file drop
on the image volume.

## Telnet / CLI additions

- **Telnet `i`, CLI `i2cscan`:** I2C bus scan. Expect `12 22 2C`.
- **Telnet `n`:** SN75DP130 raw register dump, 0x00–0x3F, 8 per line,
  through osd_log and the telnet tee. Unreadable registers print as `--`.
- **CLI `dp130`:** dump 0x00–0x3F.
- **CLI `dp130 r <reg> [n]`:** read registers.
- **CLI `dp130 w <reg> <val>`:** write a register, with readback. This is a
  debug override.
- **CLI `dp130 probe`:** re-run the address probe.
- **CLI `a2reset`:** pulse Apple II /RES for 200 ms.
- **CLI `reconfig`:** pulse FPGA RECONFIG_N low for 1 ms, then wait for
  DONE. This reloads the bitstream from flash. Telnet `g` does the same
  over JTAG.
- **`pins` and `pd`:** now show the board, the dp_test state, the mux
  address and whether the HPD wire exists.

**DP130 policy:** the firmware **never writes the DP130 on its own**. It
stays in its power-up auto mode, which snoops link-training AUX writes and
sets its own VOD, pre-emphasis and EQ. The design doc expects this to work;
I2C is only for debug overrides.

**No DP130 register map is encoded.** The SN75DP130 datasheet (SLLSE57)
was not found locally: not in `/Volumes/Storage/Downloads`, `docs/`,
`boards/*/docs` or the a2-p25 repo, and `/Volumes/Public/Datasheets` was
not accessible. So the driver is probe plus raw access only. The design
doc cites reg 0x05 bit 7 = EQ_I2C_ENABLE; nothing in the code relies on
it. Once the datasheet is at hand, decode the status and ID registers in
`sn75dp130.c`.

The full existing a2mega command set still works unchanged: telnet
`p d x e + - l v f r g u t w`.

## Apple II /RES (IO33): behaviour to know

**Wiring:**

- IO33 drives the 1A input of U1 (74LVC2G06, an **inverting open-drain**
  buffer). 1Y drives slot /RES.
- R1 (4.7k) pulls IO33 **up**.

**Consequences:**

- **The Apple II is held in reset whenever the ESP32 is not actively
  driving IO33 low.** That covers power-up before firmware runs, the S1/EN
  reset, download mode during flashing, a crashed or blank ESP32, and
  `pinMode(INPUT)`.
- The firmware drives IO33 low as the very first thing in `setup()`, about
  300 ms after power-on including the ROM bootloader. The bring-up
  bitstream has no Apple-bus logic, so the card is passive and the Apple
  II then boots normally.
- A future "hold reset until the core is ready" policy (the Enhanced
  model) is a firmware decision on top of this.

## Board observations (possible problems)

1. **U1 74LVC2G06 runs on +5V (U1.5 = +5V), but both of its inputs are
   3.3 V signals:**
   - 1A = IO33, pulled up to 3V3;
   - 2A = FPGA_BUS_~OE, pulled up to 3V3 by R3.

   At VCC = 4.5–5.5 V the datasheet VIH is 0.7 × VCC (≈3.5 V at 5.0 V), so
   a 3.3 V "high" is **below the guaranteed VIH**. It will very likely work
   at room temperature (typical threshold is ~VCC/2), but it is out of spec
   and burns some shoot-through current in the input stage.

   The open-drain outputs are 5.5 V-tolerant regardless of VCC, so U1 could
   be powered from +3V3 with no loss of function. The outputs only pull
   slot /RES and the LSF0108 EN/VREF_B net (R2 200k to +5V) low. Consider
   this for the next spin; verify on the bench that /RES releases and
   asserts cleanly.
2. **The Apple II is held in /RES whenever the ESP32 is not running
   firmware** (see the /RES section above). This may be intentional, but it
   makes ESP32 flashing in-slot reset the host, and it means a bricked
   ESP32 bricks the Apple boot. A weak pull-*down* on IO33 instead of the
   R1 pull-up would invert the default to "released".
3. **No ESP32 control of DP130 RSTN or EN.** The only recovery is a power
   cycle (or I2C, if the part has a soft reset). The design doc listed an
   optional ESP32 GPIO here; IO7, IO8 and IO9 are free if a respin wants
   it.
4. **ESP32_INT_N (B2) is the only FPGA-to-ESP32 sideband line.** The
   dp_test bitstream reuses it as HPD-in, which is fine for bring-up, but in
   production HPD must go over OSPI. Free ESP32 pads (IO7–9, IO34–37) have
   no FPGA connection.
5. The title block of the root sheet still says "For Tang Primer 60K/138K
   SOM". This is cosmetic.

No pin-level errors were found in the ESP32 section. Every net goes where
the design doc says.

## Open questions

- **TUSB546A I2C address with A0/A1 floating:** 0x12 is assumed. The
  firmware auto-detects in 0x10–0x17 and logs `USBC: DP MUX AT 0xNN (NOT
  0x12)` if the mux answers elsewhere.
- **SN75DP130 address:** 0x2C is from the design doc and is unverified
  against the datasheet. The firmware probes 0x2C–0x2F.
- **DP130 register map:** needed to decode the dump. Get SLLSE57.
- **TUSB546A EQ ladder:** does it match the TUSB1046A's, so the dB labels
  on `+`/`-` are right?
- **FLIPSEL and AUX_SBU_OVR on the a2p25 SBU routing:** the a2mega
  convention is reused, and telnet `f` flips it live if AUX is crossed.
- **Production HPD path:** the OSPI register still needs to be defined
  together with the displayport1 production core.

## Files

- `usbc_port.c/.h`, `usb_pd.h` (2026-10-12): DR_Swap retry/give-up policy
  for the sink+UFP attach (powered adapters), `USB_PD_CTRL_NOT_SUPPORTED`;
  `tests/host/test_dr_swap.c` + `run.sh` runs both test programs. See
  "PD: Data-Role Swap for powered adapters" above.

There is one known issue outside this work: `BOARD_REV=102` (a2mega 1.0a2x)
fails to link at HEAD with an undefined `usbc_virtual_replug_fast`. The
cause is that `wedge_watch.c` calls the USB-C glue, which 102 does not
build. That failure was already there before these changes.

## Bench traps (10-12)

- **Mac-side DTR/RTS and the S3's auto-download logic.** The USB-Serial-JTAG
  peripheral maps the host's DTR/RTS onto IO0/EN: a port opened (or left)
  with DTR asserted and RTS released holds IO0 low, so the next reset — an
  esptool hard reset, a console open, even a manual EN tap — lands in ROM
  download mode (`rst:0x15 USB_UART_CHIP_RESET, boot:0x20 DOWNLOAD`). Seen
  repeatedly on 10-12 after flashing; the only reliable recovery was to
  unplug the Mac cable and power-cycle. Use telnet (WiFi) as the console
  whenever possible and keep serial for flashing; `scratchpad/console.py`
  parks both lines deasserted.
- Once the firmware is in USB host mode the Mac sees no device at all; to
  flash, reboot with the Mac attached (device-first window) or hold BOOT.
- With a Mac on USB1 the board is back-powered through PTC F1: an IIgs
  power cycle does not reboot the ESP32.

## Updating the firmware without the download-mode dance (10-12)

Builds on the OTA partition scheme (`PartitionScheme=default`, two app
slots). Put `build/a2fpga_esp32.ino.bin` on the image volume — copy it to
the USB stick, or FTP it to the board (`curl -T build/a2fpga_esp32.ino.bin
ftp://<board-ip>/`, which lands on whatever is mounted at /sdcard) — then
FIRMWARE menu → `UPDATE MCU (.BIN ON VOLUME)` → pick the file → `INSTALL
MCU FIRMWARE NOW`; or over the serial/telnet CLI `fwupdate <file>` then
`fwupdate go`. The board restarts into the other slot (`MCU SLOT: ota_x`
on the FIRMWARE screen). `make upload` over USB1 still works for the
bench and is required once to install the OTA partition table.
